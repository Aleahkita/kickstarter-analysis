# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Overview:
This project focused on analyzing Kickstarter campaign data to determine if there were certain factors that made a campaign successful. The project also focused on the estimated fundraising goals needed based on a comparison to campaigns in the same category/subcategory.

---
## Analysis and challenges
I performed my analysis by looking for trends in the data of campaigns as a whole and my client's category of interest.
Questions I looked to answer during my analysis included:
* How successful was the Theater category as a whole in comparison to other parent categories?
* What did the outcomes of the Theater category and Plays subcategory look like?
* Is there an optimal time to launch a campaign?
* What were the mean and median goals/pledged amounts of successful and failed campaigns?

## Distribution of outcomes based on parent category and subcategory
---
Sheet PC1 displays the outcomes of parent categories. As a whole, it seems that the Theater category is a popular and generally successful category as reflected in the Parent Category Outcomes chart.

The data can then be narrowed down to show a similar graph of outcomes for campaigns in the US of which 525 successful outcomes out of 912.

## Optimal time to launch a campaign
When analyzing outcomes based on launch date, it seems that successful campaigns are launched in May and June (and tapers off toward the end of the year). Narrowing the parent category to Theater shows a similar trend, but with the most success when launched in May.

## Mean and median goals/pledge amounts of campaigns
Failed kickstarters had a much higher goal than successful campaigns, however the pledged amount of failed campaigns was significantly lower.

## Research on musicals in Great Britain
---
Analysis on musicals in Great Britain are visualized using a box plot (Box Plot (GB Musicals)) to get a rough idea of funding needed. The estimated fundraising goal is quite higher than outlier of the pledged amount.

---
## Recommendations
Fundraising campaigns for Theater productions are popular and largely successful.
Start fundraising in May or June.
A goal of $10,000 might be too high for a musical campaign considering the median goal/pledged amounts of successful vs failed campaigns.
The fundraising goal of a possible play in Great Britain is too high considering the mean of the goal box plot sits well above the outlier of the pledged data, consider reducing the goal.
